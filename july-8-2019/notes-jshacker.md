# General Notes

### The Contract
1. Reiterate the question
2. Ask clarifying questions
3. Provide an example case
  a. Remember to think about edge / null test cases
4. Give as much accurate data to help hiring manager get a general idea of skills and communication level.

### The Approach
1. Demonstrate your general approach
  a. Visual - Diagrams, Flow Chart, etc.
  b. Talk - general understanding of where you're starting, what you want it to do, and where you want your end result to be
2. Understand what the optimal solution should be
  a. BigO time and space - Complexities of the code
3. Know the trade-offs of brute force vs ideal algorithm
4. Talk, talk, talk - really make sure you and the interviewer know exactly what the expectations are, what your thought processes is, and make sure there is agreement
5. Do all this before writing code!!!

### Writing Code
1. Leave space for code
2. Write in native language - idiomatic code
3. Small companies likely want you to code in a specific language
  a. Check this before interview and key performance issues of that language
4. Confirm packages with interviewer and understand what each one does
 a. Know what complexities this may add to your code - Does this make your code run slower? Is there space issues?
5. Be consistent with conventions of the language
  a. camelCase, Snake_case, etc.
  b. Indenting, general structure, etc.
6. Run your test cases on the code


### Other Key Thoughts
Be prepared to review your OWN projects!
What key algorithms did you use? How could these be applied to other types of scenarios?
